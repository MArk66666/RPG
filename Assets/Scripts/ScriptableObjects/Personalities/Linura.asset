  description: Lilura is a young and incredibly beautiful demoness, hails from the
    heart of the demon's mainland. A fierce warrior, she respects strength and is
    unforgiving towards the weak, as it is common in her land. Yet, beneath her steely
    exterior lies a yearning for tenderness. Tragically, her village was decimated
    by humans in her youth, igniting her quest for vengeance. Her irascible nature
    and mistrust make it challenging for her to bond with strangers. Although she's
    never experienced true love, the right person might unveil her vulnerable side
